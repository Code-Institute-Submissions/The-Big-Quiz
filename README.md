## Purpose:
The purpose of this quiz is to test peoples general knowledge, keep track of their score and then add there names to a high score leaderboard.



# My Idea:
* My  idea for this project was to make a quiz that could test all levels of knowledge from an adult to a child.

# My Quiz:
## Home page features:
* A home page with a play button and highscore button.
## Quiz page features:
* A quiz page with a home button, questions answers and a score counter.
## End page features:
* An end page with a save, play again and a home button. Also an input box to enter your name for highscore memory.
## Highscore page features
* A highscore page which show the users with the highest score plus a home button.
## Combined features for all pages:
* A good balance of questions to test all minds.
* Bright colours on all pages so the users can clearly see everything on the pages.
* A finger pointer cursor that changes on different parts of the page to show the user what to do.
* Color coding for right answers which turn green, and wrong answers which turn red.
* A highscore tracker to keep log of every username and score.

# UX/UI
The quiz was created to show my programming knowledge of Javascript, HTML and CSS.

# Site Goals

* To show what i have learned in CSS, JAVASCRIPT and HTML. 
* The provide an interactive experience that is easily accessible in terms of navigation and to manouver throughout the site.
* To personalise the quiz end score to each user.
* To easily be able to see their progress and how many questions there are left.
* To display how many correct points the user has achieved throughout the quiz at all times.
* It needs to be instantly engaging to encourage the user to play the game.
* Questions to be randomised and drawn from a bank of available questions.
* The user must be able to leave the quiz if they wish to, and return to the home page.<br><br>
#

# The overall goal:
* To be easy for the user to start game play.
* To be able to easily navigate throughout the site.
* To be able to visit the leaderboard and review their highscores.

- I used Nova Squared font so all the writing was clear to the user and readable.
- Big boxes for all my buttons so the users could always see what the cursor was doing at all times.

# Bugs and Errors:
* My javascript had two bugs, The first one was in the game javascript. When i added a highscore it returned a response of null. But with the help of google and slack i finally realized when the user pressed save i had disabled my save button. the fix was simple just read over my work carefully at all stages.

* The second one my css was different one all pages i coudnt understand why. With help from my tutor he made me see my problem i had forgit to link my css file to each page in my html files.<br><br>
