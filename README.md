## Purpose:
The purpose of this quiz is to test peoples general knowledge, keep track of their score, and then add their names to a high score leaderboard.



# My Idea:
* My  idea for this project was to make a quiz that could test all levels of knowledge, from children to adults.

# My Quiz:
## Home page features:
* A home page with a play button and highscore button.
## Quiz page features:
* A quiz page with a home button, questions, answers, and a score counter.
## End page features:
* An end page has a save, play again, and a home button option. Also, there is input box to enter your name for highscore memory.
## Highscore page features
* A highscore page which shows the users who recieve the highest score. Also a home button is on display.
## Combined features for all pages:
* A good balance of questions to test all minds.
* Bright colours on all pages so the users can clearly see everything on the pages.
* A finger pointer cursor that changes on different parts of the page to show the user what to do.
* Color coding framework for right answers and wrong answers, were right answers turn green and wrong answers turn red.
* A highscore tracker to keep a log of every username and score.

# UX/UI
The quiz was created to show my programming knowledge of Javascript, HTML and CSS.

# Site Goals

* To show what i have learned in CSS, JAVASCRIPT and HTML. 
* To provide an interactive experience that is easily accessible in terms of navigation and to manouver throughout the site.
* To personalise each users highscore to the quizes leaderboard.
* To easily be able to see their progress and how many questions are left.
* To display how many correct points the user has achieved throughout the quiz at all times.
* It needs to be instantly engaging to encourage the user to play the game.
* Questions to be randomised and drawn from a bank of available questions.
* The user must be able to leave the quiz if they wish to, and return to the home page.<br><br>
#

# The overall goal:
* To be easy for the user to start game play.
* To be able to easily navigate throughout the site.
* To be able to visit the leaderboard and review their highscores.

# Functionality
* All links were hovered over and clicked on to ensure accessibility.
* Pages all load correctly on all device screen sizes.
* Navigation buttons across different devices and screen sizes worked as intended.
* All font awesome icons load on as intended.<br><br>

#
# Bugs and Errors:
* Initially, my javascript had two bugs, the first one was in the game javascript. When i added a highscore it returned a response of null. However, with the help of google and slack, I finally realised that when the user pressed save the option was disabled. Nevertheless, this issue was remedied easily as I just enabled the save button.

* The second issue was my CSS file was different on all pages and I coudnt understand why. So, thanks to my tutor he helped me to recognise that i had forgotten to link my CSS file to each page in my HTML files.<br><br>
